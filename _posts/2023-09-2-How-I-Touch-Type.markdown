Which finger for 6?

I accidently know a keyboard which is microsoft ergonomic keyboard. It's keyboard most werid. It's key 6 is seperate and put the left of the keyboard layout

It's seem the fact the key 6 is really type by the left index finger. If is a fact. Then how to type the top row key 1234567890-= or !@#$%^&\*()\_+

How I type the key of the top of row. 
Number row: Put you index finger into the homekey F and J. And let you finger to stretch. You will find which key you finger will touch. Me: the 4 and 8 become home key for index finger. 

-   LL for 1
-   LR for 2
-   LM for 3
-   LI for 4 5 6
-   RI for 7 8
-   RM for 9
-   RR for 0

You move hands and each finger to touch the keys respectively when you type the many numbers. 

-   Type the numbers 2314 use LR LM LP LI
-   Type the numbers 6742 use LI RI LI LR

If you numbers is too many like telephone numbers. I advice to you use the 9 nums pad to type. 

Type `~!@#$%^&\*()-_=+ Backspace or numbers little not too much.

-   LR for !~`@12
-   LM for #3
-   LI for $%^456
-   RI for &*78
-   RM for ( 9
-   RR for )0-_=+Backspace

Why doing this? Because you not move your hands when type.
